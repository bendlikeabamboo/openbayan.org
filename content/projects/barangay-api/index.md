    A containerizable FastAPI application for the list of Philippine regions, 
    provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangay according to the August 2025 
    masterlist from Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) Release.

    This project is a FastAPI wrapper around the 
    [barangay](https://pypi.org/project/barangay) package, providing a simple and 
    efficient way to interact with the Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) data.

    Features include a performant fuzzy-search for barangays (0.02s per match), and
    traversible REST API endpoints for Philippine administrative areas, and PSGC focused
    REST API endpoints.
